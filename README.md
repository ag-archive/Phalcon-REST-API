# Phalcon-REST-API
Skeleton for REST API on Phalcon PHP framework

Initially was created for TravelMind project.

This project was my PoC (proof of concept) for using PHP7 + Phalcon PHP. 

This combination shows incredible speed because of usage fastest version of PHP and fastest PHP framework in the world!

At the moment project management decided to go forward with Node.JS, so this skeleton will not be used. But I decide to keep it for history :)

What was done:
* users singnup
* users login
* users logout
* error handler

All data is transferred in JSON format, sensitive data is securely protected by bcrypt algorithm (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)
